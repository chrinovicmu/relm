 * into the virtual-APIC page so subsequent hardware-satisfied *reads*
 * observe it. Notable per-register semantics handled below:
 *   - ID/LDR keep only bits 31:24; TPR keeps 7:0; DFR forces 27:0 to 1;
 *   - VERSION, ISR/TMR/IRR bitmaps and timer CCR are read-only — writes
 *     are silently ignored like hardware;
 *   - TPR writes recompute PPR;
 *   - EOI triggers the full end-of-interrupt sequence (relm_apic_eoi);
 *   - SVR bit 8 is the software-enable switch (tracked in is_enabled);
 *   - ESR write-0-to-latch: pending errors move into the readable ESR;
 *   - ICR_LOW *sends an IPI* (relm_apic_handle_icr_write);
 *   - TIMER_ICR arms the timer (captures start timestamp) or stops it
 *     when 0 is written; LVT_TIMER bits 18:17 select the timer mode.
